.. glossary::

    activecode
        A unique interpreter environment that allows Python to be executed from within a web browser.

    algorithm
        A general step by step process for solving a problem.

    bug
        An error in a program.

    byte code
        An intermediate language between source code and object code. Many
        modern languages first compile source code into byte code and then
        interpret the byte code with a program called a *virtual machine*.

    codelens
        An interactive environment that allows the user to control the step by step execution of a Python program

    comment
        Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone
        reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the
        program.

    compile
        To translate a program written in a high-level language into a
        low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution.

    debugging
        The process of finding and removing any of the three kinds of
        programming errors.

    exception
        Another name for a runtime error.

    executable
        Another name for object code that is ready to be executed.

    formal language
        Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific
        purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs;
        all programming languages are formal languages.

    high-level language
        A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for
        humans to read and write.

    interpret
        To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one
        line at a time.

    low-level language
        A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to
        execute; also called machine language or assembly language.

    natural language
        Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.

    object code
        The output of the compiler after it translates the program.

    parse
        To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.

    portability
        A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer.

    print function
        A function used in a program or script that causes the Python
        interpreter to display a value on its output device.

    problem solving
        The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and
        expressing the solution.

    program
        A sequence of instructions that specifies to a computer actions and
        computations to be performed.

    programming language
		A formal notation for representing solutions.

    Python shell
        An interactive user interface to the Python interpreter. The user of a
        Python shell types commands at the prompt (>>>), and presses the return
        key to send these commands immediately to the interpreter for
        processing.

    runtime error
        An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute
        but that prevents the program from continuing.

    semantic error
        An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the
        programmer intended.

    semantics
        The meaning of a program.

    shell mode
        A style of using Python where we type expressions at the command
        prompt, and the results are shown immediately.  Contrast with
        **source code**, and see the entry under **Python shell**.

    source code
        A program, stored in a file, in a high-level language before being compiled or interpreted.

    syntax
        The structure of a program.

    syntax error
        An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse --- and
        therefore impossible to interpret.

    token
        One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program,
        analogous to a word in a natural language.


    assignment statement
        A statement that assigns a value to a name (variable). To the left of
        the assignment operator, ``=``, is a name. To the right of the
        assignment token is an expression which is evaluated by the Python
        interpreter and then assigned to the name. The difference between the
        left and right hand sides of the assignment statement is often
        confusing to new programmers. In the following assignment:

        .. sourcecode:: python

             n = n + 1

        ``n`` plays a very different role on each side of the ``=``. On the
        right it is a *value* and makes up part of the *expression* which will
        be evaluated by the Python interpreter before assigning it to the name
        on the left.

    assignment token
        ``=`` is Python's assignment token, which should not be confused
        with the mathematical comparison operator using the same symbol.

    class
		see **data type** below

    comment
        Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone
        reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the
        program.

    data type
        A set of values. The type of a value determines how it can be used in
        expressions. So far, the types you have seen are integers (``int``),
        floating-point numbers (``float``), and strings (``str``).

    decrement
        Decrease by 1.


    evaluate
        To simplify an expression by performing the operations in order to
        yield a single value.

    expression
        A combination of operators and operands (variables and values) that represents a
        single result value.  Expressions are evaluated to give that result.

    float
        A Python data type which stores *floating-point* numbers.
        Floating-point numbers are stored internally in two parts: a *base* and
        an *exponent*. When printed in the standard format, they look like
        decimal numbers. Beware of rounding errors when you use ``float``\ s,
        and remember that they are only approximate values.

    increment
        Both as a noun and as a verb, increment means to increase by 1.

    initialization (of a variable)
        To initialize a variable is to give it an initial value.
        Since in Python variables don't exist
        until they are assigned values, they are initialized when they are
        created.  In other programming languages this is not the case, and
        variables can be created without being initialized, in which case they
        have either default or *garbage* values.

    int
        A Python data type that holds positive and negative **whole** numbers.

    integer division
        An operation that divides one integer by another and yields an integer.
        Integer division yields only the whole number of times that the
        numerator is divisible by the denominator and discards any remainder.

    keyword
        A reserved word that is used by the compiler to parse program; you
        cannot use keywords like ``if``, ``def``, and ``while`` as variable
        names.

    modulus operator
		Also called remainder operator or integer remainder operator.  Gives the remainder after performing integer division.

    object
		Also known as a data object (or data value).  The fundamental things that programs are designed to
		manipulate (or that programmers ask to do things for them).

    operand
        One of the values on which an operator operates.

    operator
        A special symbol that represents a simple computation like addition,
        multiplication, or string concatenation.

    prompt string
		Used during interactive input to provide the user with hints as to what type of value to enter.

    reference diagram
        A picture showing a variable with an arrow pointing to the value (object) that the variable refers to. See also **state snapshot**.

    rules of precedence
        The set of rules governing the order in which expressions involving
        multiple operators and operands are evaluated.

    state snapshot
        A graphical representation of a set of variables and the values to
        which they refer, taken at a particular instant during the program's
        execution.

    statement
        An instruction that the Python interpreter can execute.  So far we have
        only seen the assignment statement, but we will soon meet the
        ``import`` statement and the ``for`` statement.

    str
        A Python data type that holds a string of characters.

    type conversion function
		A function that can convert a data value from one type to another.

    value
        A number or string (or other things to be named later) that can be
        stored in a variable or computed in an expression.

    variable
        A name that refers to a value.

    variable name
        A name given to a variable. Variable names in Python consist of a
        sequence of letters (a..z, A..Z, and _) and digits (0..9) that begins
        with a letter.  In best programming practice, variable names should be
        chosen so that they describe their use in the program, making the
        program *self documenting*.
